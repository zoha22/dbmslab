Create images from PDF files?</em> \r<br />\n PDFsharp comes with a preview control designed to visualize drawing operations of the XGraphics object, but it <strong>cannot render PDF files</strong>. \r<br />\n<br />\n Further the DrawImage function can be used to draw so called form XObjects in PDF pages. If you try to render such an object in the preview, only the bounding box is drawn to show that it cannot be rendered. \r<br />\n<br />\n The PDFsharp Samples show how to invoke Adobe Reader or Acrobat to view or print PDF files and how to invoke GhostScript to create images from PDF pages. \r<br />\n<br />\n See FAQ: \r<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.pdfsharp.net/wiki/PDFsharpFAQ.ashx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.pdfsharp.net/wiki/PDFsharpFAQ.ashx</a><br />\n",
