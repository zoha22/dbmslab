Although the workaround might functionally be a viable temporary solution, it requires the use of another PDF manipulation library, PDF sharp, for which you have to pay to use it for commercial purposes - and to add to the confusion, the price of said library is unknown.\r\n\r\nI desperately need to know when you are planning on releasing a patch for this issue, or I will have to consider dropping the PDFSharp library altogether for future projects as well.  That would be a real shame since I really do like the simple interface and the fact that, apart from this issue, \"it just works\". \r\n\r\nI am really concerned that this issue was already the \"most wanted feature\" since 2009 and there has been no movement on it since.  \r\n\r\nSo, I would appreciate a straightforward answer... \n1) Are you planning on fixing this issue / developing this feature?\n2) If yes when can we expect a patch?",

I have resigned to use the dated version of iTextSharp, 4.1.6 ([https://www.nuget.org/packages/iTextSharp-LGPL/4.1.6](http://www.example.com)). That's the latest one that's still under LGPL. It is more difficult to use this library, but once you get going, have done a few conversions with it, it's not too bad.\nFor some things, that iTextSharp 4.1.6 cannot do - like text extraction - I use PDFClown ([http://www.stefanochizzolini.it/en/projects/clown/](http://www.example.com)). It's not the most well chosen name, but it does what it says on the box.\nI hope this helps someone. I'm sorry to say that I feel that PDFSharp is going nowhere fast.",
