    "Description": "When I insert NBSP in the paragraph and render it with RtfDocumentRenderer, I get additional space after NBSP, and it is slightly noticeable in the resulting document.\n\nCode sample\n```c#\nDocument d = new Document();\nSection s = d.AddSection();\t\t\t\nParagraph content = s.AddParagraph(\"Before NBSP\");\ncontent.AddCharacter(SymbolName.NonBreakableBlank);\t\t\t\ncontent.AddText(\"after NBSP\");\t\n\n//this results in the following RTF code: Before NBSP\\~ after NBSP\n//while correct code is: Before NBSP\\~after NBSP\n```\n\nThis bug was spotted in version 1.32.4334.0.",
