    "Description": "Rendering a character to a PDF using a symbol font has an issue if you send 16 bit unicode character with the high bits already set.  It works fine when rendering the same thing to GDI+, but fails for PDFs.  I tracked it down to a couple lines that look like this:\n\n\tglyphID = (int)ch + (descriptor.fontData.os2.usFirstCharIndex & 0xFF00);\n\nIt's adding the first symbol character index to the character to get its index, but if the character already includes the index, it shouldn't be adding it.  It should be performing a bitwise \"or\" | instead of an \"add\" +.  Just a 1 byte patch.  The line should look like this instead:\n\n\tglyphID = (int)ch | (descriptor.fontData.os2.usFirstCharIndex & 0xFF00);\n\nThere are two similar lines which need to be fixed:\nPdfSharp.Drawing.Pdf\\XGraphicsPdfRenderer.cs  line 523\nPdfSharp.Fonts\\CMapInfo.cs  line 71",
