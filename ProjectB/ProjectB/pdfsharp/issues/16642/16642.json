Unit(30, UnitType.PageWidthPercentage) or Unit(30, UnitType.PageHeightPercentage)",

      "Message": "Re 3: You know the width of a page in cm or in, so it's easy to calculate the column width for any percent value. It's easy to write a helper that does it. I wrote a helper that does something similar and I'll release it sooner or later on NuGet.\nRe 2: MigraDoc could determine the column width automatically based on the contents of each column. But I don't like that idea. The application adds the contents, thus the application can decide better how the available page width will be distributed between columns.\nRe 1: MigraDoc was designed to behave like Word. It was not designed to behave like HTML.\r\n\r\nYou call it \"issues\", I'd call it \"wishes\". I don't 1) or 2) becoming reality any time soon.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\nPlease visit the PDFsharp Support Forum:  http://forum.pdfsharp.net/\r\n\r\nThis is the place we check most frequently for questions and bug reports.\r\n\r\nThe PDFsharp web site is at http://www.pdfsharp.net/\n",
