      "Message": "I would really like to see this so decided to take a look at this... has anyone else tried this?  \r\n\r\nIt looks like this section of the code gets a data array of the font from the GDI+ library, and so requires user32.dll.  It seems it might be possible to get around this by:\r\n\r\n1 - Only using built in fonts (I think itextsharp does this).\n2 - Embedding the ttf files in the program and accessing them directly (I think ttf is true type font)\n3-  something else.\r\n\r\nDoes this seem about what might be needed?  Was going to look more but I don't know this code at all so wanted to see if other ideas were out there.",
